PART 5: Calibration-light
- Read in data from `data/`
- Use `calibration_plot` function to create a calibration curve for the logistic regression model. Set `n_bins` to 5. (The calibration plot may have less than 5 points, that's ok) 
- Use `calibration_plot` function to create a calibration curve for the decision tree model. Set `n_bins` to 5. (The calibration plot may have less than 5 points, that's ok) 
- Which model is more calibrated? Print this question and your answer. 

Extra Credit
- Compute  PPV for the logistic regression model for arrestees ranked in the top 50 for predicted risk
- Compute  PPV for the decision tree model for arrestees ranked in the top 50 for predicted risk
- Compute AUC for the logistic regression model
- Compute AUC for the decision tree model
- Do both metrics agree that one model is more accurate than the other? Print this question and your answer.
